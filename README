fso - fast [link] shortener
===========================

`fso` is a fast (see `testing`) implementation of a link shortener
written in pure C11.

# getting started

you can configure your links like so in a `config.fso` file like so:

```
/       :  https://safin.dev
test    :  https://google.com
my/url  :  https://stackoverflow.com
```

then, build with:

```
make prod
```

and run with:
```
./fso
```

# testing

running `make test` will generate a `config.fso` file with some junk
and prepare for a benchmark. note: ApacheBench must be installed to
benchmark `fso`.
