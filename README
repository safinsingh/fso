fso - fast [link] shortener
===========================

fso is a fast (see [`testing`]) implementation of a link shortener
written in pure C99.

# getting started

you can configure your links like so in a `config.fso` file like so:

```
/      :  https://safin.dev
/test  :  https://google.com
```

then, build with:

```
make prod
```

and run with:
```
./fso
```

# testing

running `make test` will generate a `config.fso` file with some junk
and prepare for a benchmark. note: `hyperfine` must be installed to
benchmark `fso`.
